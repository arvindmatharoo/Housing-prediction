# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques 🏡📈

This project was developed as part of the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition.

## 📌 Objective
Predict the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa using advanced regression techniques. The task involves applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning on a structured dataset.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset provided by Kaggle includes:
- `train.csv`: Training data with 79 explanatory variables and the target `SalePrice`
- `test.csv`: Testing data without the target
- `sample_submission.csv`: Format for submission

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- StandardScaler
- Model Building using:
  - Linear Regression
  - Lasso Regression
- Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
- Ensemble Models

## 🏁 Results
- Final Public Leaderboard Score: **0.17821 (Root Mean Squared Log Error)**
- Kaggle Rank: **3848**

## 📈 Evaluation Metric
Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook

## 📤 Submission

The final submission was generated using predictions on the Kaggle test set and saved as `sample_submission.csv`.

To recreate it:

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle (test.csv)
2. Run the notebook until the final cell
3. The model will output predictions in the correct format for submission
